# ScumKilla
My project of topdown shooter game inspired by Crimsonland. Created for studing LibGdx.
I don't own rights on graphic assets, so if you find something owned by you, i'll remove it.

You can check out web version here: http://scumkilla.rf.gd/dist/index.html

Right now i have no plans to continue this project because i move to C# and Unity or C++ and Unreal Engine.
